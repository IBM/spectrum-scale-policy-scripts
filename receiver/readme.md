## Introduction

EXTERNAL LIST policies can be used select files based on criteria and process these selected files by a custom interface script. The script `receiver.sh` is an interface script that can be used in combination with EXTERNAL LIST policies to process the selected files. 

An EXTERNAL LIST policy consists of a EXTERNAL LIST rule and a LIST RULE. The EXTERNAL LIST rule defines the interface script and allow to pass parameter to this script. The LIST rule defines criteria for the selection of files. The policy example below, defines the program `/user/local/bin/receiver.sh` as interface script and selects files in fileset `test` that have migrated. 

	/* define exclude list */
	define(  exclude_list,
	  (PATH_NAME LIKE '%/.SpaceMan/%' OR 		
	   PATH_NAME LIKE '%/.ltfsee/%' OR 			
	   PATH_NAME LIKE '%/.mmSharedTmpDir/%' OR	
	   PATH_NAME LIKE '%/.snapshots/%' OR 		
	   NAME LIKE '.mmbackupShadow%' OR 			
	   NAME LIKE 'mmbackup%')					
	) 

	/* define migrated state */ 
	define(is_migrated, (MISC_ATTRIBUTES LIKE '%V'))

	/* define the interface script */
	RULE EXTERNAL LIST 'recieve-mig' EXEC 'usr/local/bin/receiver.sh' 

	/* define the rule to select migrated files in fileset test */
	RULE 'listMig' LIST 'recieve-mig' FOR FILESET ('test') WHERE (is_migrated) AND NOT (exclude_list)


This policy can be invoked with the command:

	# mmapplypolicy fsname -P policyfile -B 1000 -m 2 -N node1,node2 --single-instance 

The parameter `fsname` denotes the name or the path of the file system or subdirectory. 
The parameter `-P policyfile` denotes the file name that includes the EXTERNAL LIST policy. 

The IBM Spectrum Scale policy engine (`mmapplypolicy`) first runs the LIST rule and selects all migrated files in fileset `test`. The full path and filenames of these files are put in file lists whereby each file list contains 1000 file name (parameter `-B 1000`). Each file list is passed to one instance of the interface script defined by the EXTERNAL LIST rule (`/usr/local/bin/receiver.sh`). The policy engine starts 2 instances of the interface script per node (parameter `-m 2`). The nodes that execute the `receiver.sh` program are node1 and node2 (`-N node1,node2`). 

When invoked by the policy engine the `receiver.sh` script obtains two arguments:

	$1: is the operation of the policy, in this case it is LIST.
	$2: is the name of the file list containing the path and file names


The file list passed to the `receiver.sh` script in argument `$2` has the following format: 
	
	48900 1741777473 0   -- /filesystem/file1

The three first numbers are IBM Spectrum Scale internal numbers (inodenumber, inodegeneration, snapid). The path and file name of the selected files is the 5th field in the file list. The `receiver.sh` extracts the path and file name and writes it to an output file `$OUTPUTFILE`. At this point you can implement your own logic to process the files. 

It is also possible to pass further arguments to the `receiver.sh` script by using the OPTS clause in the EXTERNAL LIST rule. The following example passes the string `migrated` to the `receiver.sh` script:

	RULE EXTERNAL LIST 'receiver' EXEC 'usr/local/bin/receiver.sh' OPTS 'migrated'

The OPTS clause allows to pass arguments for the processing of the file. 

The script `receiver.sh` provided in this repository does not process any file yet, it just write the path and file names to a file list. 



## Preparation

Adjust the parameters in the script `receiver.sh` when required:

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------|-------------|
| MYPATH | define paths for log files and output files. Default is `./receiver`. |
| LOGFILE | log file name that is stored in `$MYPATH`. Default is `` receiver.log` |
| OUTPUTFILE | name of the file that contains the file names identified by the policy engine. This is not the file that is produced by the policy engine but the file that just includes the path and file names selected by the policy engine. Default is `receiver.out` |
| DEFOPTS | Default options used for the `mmapplypolicy` command. | 
| LOGLEVEL | Defines the depth of logging. Default is `1`. Currently there is only level `1` implemented | 


Copy the `receiver.sh` script to a common directory of all IBM Spectrum Scale nodes that execute the script.


Create the EXTERNAL LIST policy according to the needs and specify the path of the `receiver.sh` script in the EXTERNAL LIST rule. There are three examples policy files:
[policy_receiver_mig.txt](policy_receiver_mig.txt): selects all file that are migrated and invokes `receiver.sh` with the selected path and file names.
[policy_receiver_age.txt](policy_receiver_age.txt): selects all file that have not been accessed for more than 2 days and invokes `receiver.sh` with the selected path and file names.
[policy_receiver_all.txt](policy_receiver_all.txt): selects all file and invokes `receiver.sh` with the selected path and file names.


Run the policy engine on one node:  

	# mmapplypolicy fsname -P policyfile -B 1000 -m 2 -N node1,node2 --single-instance 

The policy engine selects the files in accordance to the LIST rul√© and executes the interface script by passing the selected file names to the script. 

Running the policy engine can be automated. The GitHub project [Spectrum Scale Automation](https://github.com/nhaustein/SpectrumScaleAutomation) provides the tooling for this. 
 

## Output:

The `receiver.sh` script creates a subdirectory specified by the script parameter `$MYPATH` and logs messages in a log file denoted by parameter `$LOGFILE`. The resulting list including path and file of the selected files is written to the file denoted by `OUTPUTFILE`. 


## Combination with runpolicy.sh

Instead of running the `mmapplypolicy` command manually you can combine this with the [runpoliy script](runpolicy/readme.md). 

            ./runpolicy run fsname policyfile

Parameter `fsname` is the name of the file system where the policy should run.
Parameter `policyfile` is the name of the policy file including the EXTERNAL LIST policy that invokes that interface script `receiver.sh`.
